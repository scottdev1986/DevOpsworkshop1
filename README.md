# DevOpsworkshop1

# In this assignment, you will create a Django application and deploy it to Docker, then to Docker Compose.
# Some parts of this workshop assignment will be new to you, such as using django-admin to scaffold out the starter Django application files, setting up the sub-applications, and using Django to perform migrations. Whenever you are treading new territory, we will provide you with step-by-step instructions and explanations, similar to the exercises during the week.

# However, for other parts of this assignment where you have previously practiced commands and concepts (such as creating a virtual environment, or navigating between folders in a bash terminal), the instructions will be less explicit, and you will need to recall or review what you have learned. This will help build your brain-muscle memory. Save your files on your own, as we won't remind you!

# Consider: In developer positions, it is very common to be asked to complete tasks with minimal instructions, using technologies you have never encountered. The step-by-step instructions that we have thus far provided are helpful for learning, but this assignment is a little closer to instructions that you might receive in the real world (though still much more detailed! ...do not expect instructions at a workplace to be this explicit).
